> WIP: **This project is under heavy development, the `main` is not stable yet!**

This is an esp32 PlatformIO `esp-idf` project.

PWM Fan WIFI remote controller, can be used for cooldown system.
Available to use on esp32 & esp32c3.

Just for fun.

Currently, the WIFI and PWM GPIO are hard-coded in [main.c](/src/main.c#L18). 
The editable configuration web UI interface is currently working in progress 
and will be coming soon.
